# blood-donations
A data analysis project to predict future blood donations.

This project is based on the [Predict Blood Donations contest](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center) hosted on [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/) and mainly serves as a warm up and refresher on data analysis.

The dataset can be found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center).
